* Go

- Go is a programming language developed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, And Ken Thompson.
- It is garbage collected, has great type safety, and has concurrency built in.
- It has duck typing, type inference, and is statically linked.
- Sadly, it does not have generic types, but dont let that stop you!

* What does Go look like?

.play first.go

Go has very strict syntax:
- It requires 'Eqyptian' style brackets.
- All functions start with the 'func' keyword
- No semicolons! (kinda)
- Unused variables are errors

* Variables

.play second.go

- Variable names come before types
- Functions can return multiple values
- No parentheses needed on flow control statements

* Wheres the magic??
Right here.

.play concur.go

Concurrency!

* Another Approach...
Channels are awesome.

.play channel.go

* Polymorphism?
Go uses duck typing, if youve used python, you should feel at home.

.play duck.go

* Tools
Go has a very robust set of tools built into the language, these include:
- Compiler (obviously) (go build)
- Formatter (go fmt)
- Documentation Generator (godoc)
- Profiler (go tool pprof)
- Package Management (go get)
- And many more...

* Standard Library
Go's standard library is very small, but contains a very large amount of useful packages
