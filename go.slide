* Go

- Go is a programming language developed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, And Ken Thompson.
- It is garbage collected, has great type safety, and has concurrency built in.
- It has duck typing, type inference, and is statically linked.
- Sadly, it does not have generic types, but dont let that stop you!
